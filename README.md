This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving an infinite loop caused by an incorrectly defined dependency array in the `useEffect` hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from missing the dependency array in useEffect which causes infinite loop. The solution demonstrates the correct usage of the dependency array to prevent infinite re-renders.
